## Part 2 - Mockup Design Report for Pokédex

For this Pokédex mockup, several design decisions were made to create an engaging yet minimalistic user interface, with inspiration drawn from various websites and online Pokédex designs, including Pokémon’s official website.

1. Minimalistic Layout with White Space:
The design embraces ample white space, offering a clean and uncluttered interface. This ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for users, allowing the focus to remain on the Pokémon details.

2. Polkadot Gradient for a Digital Aesthetic:
A polkadot gradient was strategically placed in the bottom-left and top-right corners of the design. This choice was made to evoke a modern, digital feel while preserving the overall simplicity. The gradient adds a subtle dynamic effect without overwhelming the core content.

3. Subtle Pokéball Elements:
To further embed the essence of the Pokémon universe, faded Pokéballs are incorporated into the background, providing a thematic touch. Additionally, small Pokéball icons are scattered throughout the design, reinforcing the Pokédex theme in a non-intrusive manner.

These combined elements create a mockup that balances simplicity with thematic depth, ensuring a polished and immersive user experience.


## Part 3 - Prototype Report for Pokédex

Overview

This report provides an outline of the steps taken to develop the prototype, the resources used, and the challenges faced during its creation.

Project Structure

The project was structured to meet all requirements of the assignment:

	•	A clean and organized file structure was maintained throughout the project.
	•	The repository was created and organized on GitHub, with branches named according to the project requirements.
	•	Commits were frequent and well-documented, detailing each significant update and change.

Repository and Branches

	•	Main Branch: Contains the final, tested version of the prototype.
	•	Feature Branches: Separate branches were created for each feature, including responsive-design, UI-improvements, and functional-prototype.

Prototype Design and Development

Responsiveness and Modern Techniques

The prototype was built to be fully responsive, utilizing modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout. The design was optimized for multiple screen sizes and devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile:

	•	CSS Media Queries were employed to adjust layouts and component styles across various breakpoints.
	•	A CSS Framework (e.g., TailwindCSS or Bootstrap) was used for rapid styling and consistency across components.

UI and Design

The prototype UI closely resembles the provided mockup, following a cohesive and appealing design. Key design considerations included:

	•	Font Choices: Readable, modern fonts were selected to improve content legibility.
	•	Color Scheme: Colors were chosen based on the mockup and refined for accessibility, maintaining a balance between contrast and visual appeal.
	•	Intuitive Layout: Components were arranged logically to ensure easy navigation and content consumption.

The prototype includes all essential UI elements and presents a near-complete workflow, from content exploration to interactive elements like buttons and modals.

Resources Used

During the development process, the following resources were instrumental in supporting and enhancing the project:

	•	CSS Tricks and MDN Web Docs for Flexbox and Grid layout guidance.
	•	TailwindCSS Documentation (if applicable) to implement the responsive, utility-first CSS framework.
	•	Stack Overflow and GitHub Discussions for troubleshooting layout and JavaScript interactions.
	•	Font and Color Resources: Google Fonts for font selection and Colours for generating and testing accessible color palettes.

Challenges Faced

Several challenges were encountered during the development of the prototype:

	1.	Responsive Design Adjustments: Adjusting the layout for multiple screen sizes required refining breakpoints, especially for components like cards and navigation. Some media queries needed adjustments to maintain layout integrity across screen widths.
	2.	JavaScript Functionality for Interactions: Integrating event listeners and conditional rendering in JavaScript to display dynamic content (such as modals and tooltips) presented some unexpected issues, especially in handling click events and animations.
	3.	SVG and Icon Positioning: Ensuring SVG icons remained properly positioned alongside text while maintaining alignment across screen sizes was particularly challenging. Additional CSS adjustments were made to ensure consistency.
	4.	Browser Compatibility: Minor styling differences across browsers required testing and adjustments, especially for Flexbox gaps and SVG rendering.

Conclusion

This project was an opportunity to integrate various front-end development techniques, from responsive layout building to interactive JavaScript functionality. By using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and a modern CSS framework, the prototype achieved responsiveness, an intuitive UI, and a visually pleasing design that closely resembled the original mockup.

Overall, this prototype serves as a solid foundation for further enhancements and optimizations, ensuring a complete and user-friendly experience.


## Part 4 - Capstone ProjectReport for Pokédex

Overview

This report outlines the steps taken to develop the final version of the prototype, the resources used, and the challenges encountered during its creation. The product presented in this final stage meets all the requirements of the assignment, demonstrating a clean, well-organized structure; a responsive and intuitive UI; dynamic JavaScript functionality; local storage integration; and efficient retrieval of external data via the Fetch API.

Challenges Faced

1.	Efficient Data Loading for Moves

	Initially, attempting to fetch all move data at page load caused performance issues. To solve this, we deferred fetching detailed moves information until the user opened a modal for a specific Pokémon. This approach balanced efficiency and responsiveness, ensuring data was only requested when needed.

2.	Responsive Adjustments for Various Devices

	Fine-tuning the layout for different screen widths required careful use of media queries and responsive units. Cards, tooltips, and SVG icons needed incremental adjustments to maintain consistency and readability on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

3.	Maintaining Snappy Interactions

	Integrating local storage updates, favorites management, and filtering results while maintaining a fast and smooth user experience was challenging. Properly debouncing actions and using incremental fetching helped preserve performance.

4.	SVG Icon Alignment and Accessibility

	Aligning SVG icons consistently across different screen sizes and themes required iterative CSS refinements. Additionally, ensuring keyboard accessibility and proper ARIA labels was crucial to provide an inclusive experience.


Resources Used

	•	MDN Web Docs & CSS Tricks for advanced layout techniques and responsive design strategies.
	•	TailwindCSS Documentation (if applicable) for responsive classes, utility-first CSS patterns, and rapid UI prototyping.
	•	Stack Overflow & GitHub Discussions for troubleshooting fetch calls, local storage usage, and event handling intricacies.
	•	Google Fonts & Online Color Tools for selecting readable and appealing typefaces and testing accessible color combinations.


Conclusion

The final prototype successfully meets all the project requirements. It offers a highly responsive layout, a polished UI that mirrors the mockup, and a dynamic, data-driven experience. The thoughtful use of modern CSS layouts, fetch-based asynchronous loading, local storage, and well-structured JavaScript interactions result in a final product that is both robust and intuitive.

This project provided an opportunity to combine a wide range of front-end techniques—responsive design, dynamic content loading, user state persistence, and REST API integration—into a cohesive final solution.
